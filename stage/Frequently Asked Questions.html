The plugin doesn't work and when I click on the ! icon I see something telling me I need to upgrade to Hotmail Plus, what's going on?</p><p class="normal"> Microsoft has recently decided to start charging for WebDav access to Hotmail.  This will affect all newly created accounts, however some people with older Hotmail accounts will still be able to connect using the plugin as it is taking Microsoft quite some time to convert all the accounts over to their new system.  If you are seeing this error then the only way to make the plugin with with your account is to "upgrade" to Hotmail Plus.</p><p class="header">2. Can the plugin connect to xxx web email?</p><p class="normal"> The short answer is no.</p><p class="normal"> The long answer is, no. This is because the httpmail plugin relies on a protocol  implemented by hotmail. Currently services like Yahoo and Mail.com do not provide  the special protocol the plugin requires. It could be possible to write another  plugin specifically designed to access these web based email systems, but that  is a very big job.</p><p class="header">3. How did you do this?</p><p class="normal"> The source code is available at sourceforge.<br />  See http://sourceforge.net/projects/httpmail-plugin/ for more information.</p><p class="normal">I am also working on a Wiki site that will contain documentation  of everything I discover about the internals of Mail. </p><p class="header">4. Why wont my mail delete from the server?</p><p class="normal"> Messages are not removed from the server when you put them into the trash.  For them to be removed from the server you need to use the &quot;Erase Deleted  Messages&quot; item from the &quot;Mailbox&quot; menu or press âŒ˜K</p><p class="header">5. Does using this plugin count as a login to Hotmail?</p><p class="normal"> As far as I have been able to determine this seems to be the case, yes.</p></body></html>
