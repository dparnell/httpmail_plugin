Once plugged in you will get all the benefits of Mail (especially  useful is the spam filter).</p><p class="normal">Please note this plugin does <en>not</en> allow access to web based email systems.  Only those email systems that support the HttpMail protocol will work with  this plugin. This means Yahoo! and other web based email systems can not be  made to work with this plugin. See the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) file  for more information.<br/>

The manual install is still an  option, however I recommend using the installer program.</p><p class="normal"> 1. Choose the installation method, for Manual install go to step 3, to use  the installer go to step 2</p><p class="normal"> 2. Double click the installer program and press the Install button. The plugin  will now be installed. Go to step 5.</p><p class="normal"> 3. First you must identify the correct folder in which to install the plug-in.  The path is likely to be: <br />  Macintosh HD / Users / [current user name] / Library / Mail / Bundles, depending  on how your disk is organized and labeled. Double-click on your hard drive  to open it then select and open the Users folder. Select the current user's  folder - the icon looks like a home - and open it. </p><p class="normal">Look for the Library folder, then the Mail folder. In the Mail folder, if  you do not see a Bundles folder, you must create this folder by selecting File  / New Folder and name it Bundles. </p><p class="normal">Copy the httpmail.mailbundle folder (from the volume httpmail plugin)  to the Bundles folder.</p><p class="normal"> 4. In the Applications folder, look for the Utilities folder. Open the Terminal  application. Execute the following commands in a Terminal window, paying great  attention to the exact spelling, then press return.</p><p class="normal"> <code>defaults write com.apple.mail EnableBundles 1<br />  defaults write com.apple.mail BundleCompatibilityVersion 1</code></p><p class="normal"> or the following if you are running Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger)</p><p class="normal"> <code>defaults write com.apple.mail EnableBundles 1<br />  defaults write com.apple.mail BundleCompatibilityVersion 2</code></p><p class="normal"> <br />  Using copy and paste is a good way to enter the commands into the Terminal.<br />  If you get any error messages after entering the command you will need to either  install the BSD subsystem on your Mac OS X install CD, or use the installer  program in the disk image.<br /></p><p class="normal"> 5. Start Mail. It may complain that the plugin is incompatible and disable  the plugin.<br />  If this happens, then Quit Mail and you should find that the &quot;Bundles&quot; folder  created earlier has been renamed to &quot;Bundles (Disabled)&quot;. Rename  it back to &quot;Bundles&quot;, rerun the &quot;defaults&quot; command in the  terminal and restart Mail. If you used the installer, you should be able to  just run the installer again.</p><p class="normal"> 6. Start Mail and open the Preferences panel. Press the Add Account button.  In the Accounts panel, you should see a new entry in the Account Type list:  httpmail.</p><p class="normal">If you are using Panther (Mac OS X 10.3), and have yet to add an account to  Mail you will see a screen that looks something like<div align="center"><img src="docs/welcome.png" width="465" height="444"/></div></p><p class="normal">If you see this window then you will need to create an account from one of  the given account types. Httpmail will not be in this list as the plugin will  not yet be loaded. If your ISP provides an account with your net connection,  I suggest entering the account details in here. If not, or you don't want to  just put anything in to get past this window as you can delete the account  later from the Preferences window.</p><p class="normal">Add as many new Hotmail or MSN accounts as you need by filling the required  settings for each account.</p><p><div align="center"><img src="docs/account_prefs.png" width="561" height="475" /></div></p><p class="normal"> 7. Fill the Description, Email Address and Full Name fields as you deem appropriate.  Enter hotmail.com in the Incoming Mail Server field, then your Hotmail login  (for example I would put danielparnell, without the @hotmail.com!) in the User  Name field and your password into the Password field.</p><p class="normal"> For MSN accounts, enter msn.com as the Incoming Mail Server, and your full  email address as User Name. Then fill out the Password field. For example I  would enter xerbert@msn.com as my username.<div align="center"><img src="docs/msn.png" width="509" height="473" /></div></p><p class="normal"> Choose &quot;None&quot; for the outgoing mail server from the list of available outgoing servers. This  will be replaced with an automatically generated outgoing mail server. </p><p class="normal"> 8. Select the Advanced panel and check the appropriate settings. There is  a drop down box that allows you to choose how you want your messages to be  handled on the server after download: mark as read, delete, or do nothing.  When choosing the appropriate handling, keep in mind that those servers have  mailbox size limitations.</p><p class="normal"> <br />  9. Check the Advanced tab of the account preferences and make sure the account is enabled.</p><p class="normal"> 10. To install and activate the httpmail plugin for another user, you must  first logout and login with the new user's name. Then repeat the installation  for that user.<br /></p><p class="normal">Note: If you are using a HTTP proxy, you will need to have visited some web  site using a Web browser (like OmniWeb or Safari) that puts the proxy username  and password into your Keychain. Alternatively, you can manually add a proxy  setting in the Network panel of your System Preferences. Create an entry using  your proxy server name (eg proxy.foo.com), Add the username and password details  for access when prompted.<br /></p><p class="header">Notes on the synchronization code</p><p class="normal">The synchronization code is very simple at the moment and is one way. </p><p class="normal">If you read a message, it will be marked as read on the server, and if you  delete or move a message it will be deleted on the server. If you move a message  to another folder in the same account it will not be moved on the server as  yet. Messages moved into the httpmail account will not be sent to the server.</p><p class="normal">Synchronization is performed at message download time, so if you mark a message  as read, it will not be updated on the server until the next time Mail connects  to the server to fetch mail.</p>
<p class="normal"><b>NOTE:</b> If you move a message from the account it was downloaded into
another local mailbox, the message will be removed from the remote server the next time Mail
accesses the remote server.  This also happens if a Mail rule moves a message on download.</p><p class="header">How do I get rid of this thing?</p><p class="normal"> 1. To de-install the plugin, you must delete the httpmail.mailbundle  folder in the Bundles folder of the current user.The path is likely to be:  Macintosh HD / Users / [current user name] / Library / Mail / Bundles. You  must also delete every http-Mail folder that was created in the Bundles folder. </p><p class="normal"> 2. Then you must de-activate the plug-in by executing the following command  in a Terminal window, paying great attention to the exact spelling:</p><p class="normal"> <code>defaults write com.apple.mail EnableBundles 0</code><br /></p><p class="header">If you are upgrading from an older version:</p><p class="normal"> 1. Make sure Mail is not running</p><p class="normal"> 2. Run the installer. This will overwrite the old plugin and replace it with  the new one.</p><p class="normal"> Alternatively if you want to do it manually</p><p class="normal"> 1. Make sure Mail is not running</p><p class="normal"> 2. You must replace the httpmail.mailbundle plugin with the newer one. 
  Simply trash the OLD httpmail.mailbundle  folder from the Bundles folder of the current user. The path is likely to be:  Macintosh HD / Users / [current user name] / Library / Mail / Bundles.<br />    <br />  3. Then copy (drag) the NEW httpmail.mailbundle folder from the volume  httpmail plugin you just downloaded, to the Bundles folder.</p><p class="normal"> There is no need to modify your existing mailboxes. If your upgrade was successful,  the advanced panel of your accounts will reflect the new version number.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="header">Change History:</p><p class="normal"> v1.46 - June 4th 2005<br />  Jaguar, Panther and Tiger release<br/>
