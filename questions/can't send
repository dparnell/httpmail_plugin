G'day Josh,

    sorry I've taken so long to reply.  Since the birth of my daughter I've been kind of pre-occupied looking after her :)
It is taking me a really long time to get through the backlog of emails

What you need to do is delete the outgoing mail server and set the plugin to use the "None" setting.
The plugin will then create a new outgoing mail server that should be correctly configured.
