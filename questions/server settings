G'day Gautam,

    sorry I've taken so long to reply.  Since the birth of my daughter I've been kind of pre-occupied looking after her :)
It is taking me a really long time to get through the backlog of emails

The incoming mail server information isn't actually used by the plugin.
The outgoing mail server should be set to the "None" setting and the plugin will then automatically create a correctly configured outgoing mail server for you.
