G'day Sened,

    sorry I've taken so long to reply.  Since the birth of my daughter I've been kind of pre-occupied looking after her :)
It is taking me a really long time to get through the backlog of emails

I assume you are running under Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger).

I have seen this problem several times and I am looking for a good fix.  What seems to work for most people is to delete the account and re-create it.

Daniel
