G'day Jacques,

    sorry I've taken so long to reply.  Since the birth of my daughter I've been kind of pre-occupied looking after her :)
It is taking me a really long time to get through the backlog of emails

It sounds like you are having problems with a new Hotmail account.
Most probably the account needs to be "upgraded" to Hotmail Plus before it will work :(

Sorry

Daniel
