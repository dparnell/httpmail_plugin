G'day Gautam,

    sorry I've taken so long to reply.  Since the birth of my daughter I've been kind of pre-occupied looking after her :)
It is taking me a really long time to get through the backlog of emails

Does the username field in your account preferences contain your full hotmail email address?
If not, you should change it so that it does and that should fix the problem
