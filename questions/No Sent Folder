G'day Kathriel,

    sorry I've taken so long to reply.  Since the birth of my daughter I've been kind of pre-occupied looking after her :)
It is taking me a really long time to get through the backlog of emails

You should make sure that the "Store sent messages on the server" option is off on the "Mailbox Behaviors" tab of the account preferences.

If you are running Tiger, then you may also need to create another non-httpmail account in Mail, say POP or IMAP to force Mail to create the Sent Items folder properly.

Daniel
